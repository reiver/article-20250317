# Blogging on the Fediverse with WriteFreely

Platforms such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) are perfect for sharing short thoughts or quick updates.
But, what if you have more to say — something closer to the length of an article?

That’s where [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/) shines.

Developed by [Matt Baer](https://writing.exchange/@matt), **WriteFreely** is an open-source **blogging** platform designed to work with the Fediverse and the Social Web.
It allows you to write long-form content using the simplicity of **markdown** formatting.
True to its name, WriteFreely emphasizes minimalism, lightweight design, and ease of use, making it the ideal tool for creating thoughtful, extended posts.
