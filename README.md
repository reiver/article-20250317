# Blogging on the Fediverse with WriteFreely

Platforms such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) are great when what you have to say is fits into a short note.
But, what about when what you need say is much longer, and more the length of an article.

That is where a tool such as [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/) come into play.

Created by [Matt Baer](https://writing.exchange/@matt), **WriteFreely** is an open-source blogging platform for the **Fediverse** and the **Social Web**.
